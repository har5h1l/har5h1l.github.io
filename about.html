                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Harshil, a student from the Bay Area, passionate about AI's ability to solve challenges in science. I've researched Active Inference in autonomous navigation and am exploring the broad field of machine learning and data science. My work focuses on developing intelligent systems that can operate in complex environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>I spend a lot of time working on machine learning and data science projects, and I'm particularly interested in applying these techniques to biological and scientific challenges. My research in active inference has sparked a deep interest in neuroscience and cognitive science, which I'm eager to explore further.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond research, I enjoy debate, where I hone my skills in argumentation, articulation, and critical thinking through Public Forum debate. Tennis has been a part of my life for the past six years, and I'm an active member of my high school team. I'm also the president of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rise.tennis/" target="_blank">RISE Tennis</a>, an initiative dedicated to making the sport more accessible to everyone.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I'm not working on AI or competing, you'll probably find me reading books, exploring mathematics, biking, spending time with friends, working on fitness, experimenting with healthy recipes, or finding ways to improve myself. I consider myself a life-long learner because I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to expand my understanding of the world.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy sharing ideas and insights through my articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@harshilshah28" target="_blank">Medium</a> and on this website. Writing helps me organize my thoughts and connect with others who share similar interests in AI, machine learning, and technology.</p>
